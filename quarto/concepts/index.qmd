The Homer Multitext project has assembled a rich collection of images and data about manuscripts of the *Iliad* with *scholia*, including digital editions of many texts. Texts in the archive are encoded in TEI XML format.

The motivation for the `HmtGutenberg` package is to make diplomatic versions of the texts available in formats that humans can read. It uses the `HmtArchive` package to extract diplomatic editions from the archive, and organizes *Iliad* and *scholia* texts by physical page of the manuscript.  

`HmtGutenberg` supports editions with or without Markdown formatting, so that its output can be readily used digitally as a plain-text file, or can be printed or read on screen in a formatted display using any markdown-aware application.
