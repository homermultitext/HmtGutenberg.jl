# HmtGutenberg.jl


`HmtGutenberg` is a Julia package for composing a variety of editions of the texts in the Homer Multitext project's archive.


The current release focuses on simple pure-text editions (plain text and markdown), organizing lines of the *Iliad* and *scholia* together by manuscript page.
